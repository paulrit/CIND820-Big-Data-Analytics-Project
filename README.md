# CIND820-Big-Data-Analytics-Project

Abstract

With the world getting more digital post-pandemic and the travel industry picking up, understanding your customer’s digital footprint is important in the hotel industry. Reviews play a big part in building trust towards new customers and building brand loyalty among old ones. Beyond a rating system, understanding  the sentiment around good and bad reviews can lead to valuable insights. It can be used in such areas like customer experience, reducing customer churn, upselling opportunities etc. Also, understanding similar characteristics between good and bad hotels can give us insights into hotel segmentation. 

The dataset that I have chosen to work on would be the “515K Hotel Reviews Data in Europe” dataset, which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe?datasetId=2142&language=Python.

The theme of my project will be around sentiment analysis and clustering. The following general techniques will be used: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Text Pre-processing, Feature Engineering, Modeling (e.g. Naive Bayes, K-Means, Decision-Tree, TF-IDF) etc.  

This project would be able answer the following research questions: Can we predict that a good/bad review is given through the text of the review? To what degree is that the case?Are certain words typical of either bad or good reviews? Do good or bad hotels tend to be near each other?

I will be using statistical technique to tokenize the words and semantic analysis as well. 

The tools used in this project are: Microsoft Azure Platform, Python and Jupyter Notebook. In terms of packages: Pandas/Matplotlib/Seaborn for EDA, NLTK for the natural language processing tasks and Scikit-Learn for the machine learning tasks. 


Refined Research Question
What words in the text of a hotel review in Europe indicate whether is it good or bad? Also, do good and bad hotels tend to congregate with each other?
