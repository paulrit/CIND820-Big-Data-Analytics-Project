Abstract 

With the world getting more digital post-pandemic and the travel industry picking up, understanding your customer’s digital footprint is important in the hotel industry. Reviews play a big part in building trust towards new customers and building brand loyalty among old ones. Beyond a rating system, understanding  the sentiment around good and bad reviews can lead to valuable insights. It can be used in such areas like customer experience, reducing customer churn, upselling opportunities etc. Also, understanding similar characteristics between good and bad hotels can give us insights into hotel segmentation.
